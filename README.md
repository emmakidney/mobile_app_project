## Car Crash Notification App

#### Emma Kidney / 20074350

##### Application Overview:

This application is built for the second Mobile Application Development Assignment as part of the Mobile Application Development module in the H(Dip) in Computer Science course at Waterford Institute of Technology.

This App was intended to be able to record car crashes notified by users in order to warn others of potential traffic or delays. The app is built following the labs provided in class of the case study Placemarks.

##### Features:

This App used Fire base basic authentication for standard email and password sign up and login.

Fire base is also used for the Database, providing real time data entered by users. 

There is basic application navigation. Upon logging in or signing up, users can view the car crash information that has been entered by any user. 

##### Errors / Issues:

The hamburger used in the toolbar is not showing the menu correctly. The options are invisible, however depending on what area you click you will be navigated to a different part of the app. The top section brings the user to the Map of all Car Crashes, the middle brings the user to add a car crash, and the bottom to log out. 

When entering the location of a crash, the marker does not move on clicking. This prevents the location of a car crash being set.
